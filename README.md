# password_generator
I created this password generator after following a video tutorial based on <a href = "https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects/">Florin Pop's 100 Projects in 100 days</a>. My Coding Bootcamp instructor helped me modify the JavaScript file so that it fit within the parameters of the homework assignment and matched the functionality that it should have.
